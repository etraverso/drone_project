US Drone Strikes in Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia

Evan Traverso, Aaron Kaufman and Spencer Davenport

    Our project examines the covert use of unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, but the United States Government. The goal of this project was to analyze data collected about these covert strikes by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/). The Bureau has been tracking the use of armed drones by the US, with data going back to the first use of an armed drone for targeted killing in 2002 (Yemen). Much of the bureau's methodology is based off foreign media and eye witness accounts of these strikes (https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/05/23/get-the-data-what-the-drones-strike/). As the US government does not release information regarding the CIA's drone program in these countries, it is impossible to get exact numbers.
