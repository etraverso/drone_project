{"name":"US Drone Strikes","tagline":"","body":"## The Data.\r\n### Our project examines the covert use of unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, but the United States Government. The goal of this project was to analyze data collected about these covert strikes by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/). The Bureau has been tracking the use of armed drones by the US, with data going back to the first use of an armed drone for targeted killing in 2002 (Yemen). Much of the bureau's methodology is based off foreign newspapers and eye witness accounts of these strikes (https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/05/23/get-the-data-what-the-drones-strike/). \r\n\r\n## What Does This Mean?\r\n\r\n### As the US government does not release information regarding the CIA's drone program in these countries, it is impossible to get exact numbers. Our findings indicate that civilians and children account for a large percentage of those killed in strikes, which counters the narrative that these are pinpoint precision strikes with little to no collateral. Our data also indicates an enormous increase in people killed by drone strikes beginning in 2008 with the beginning of the Obama Administration\r\n\r\nhttps://plot.ly/~evan.a.traverso/8/us-drone-strikes-by-country/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nEvan Traverso (@etraverso), Aaron Kaufman (@kaufman1), Spencer Davenport (@davenpsj).
